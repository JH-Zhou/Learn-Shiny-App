# Learn-Shiny-App
Few days ago, my dad asked me to help him calculate the area of triangle by given length of three sides.

I searched formular online and calculated it for him. 

One day later, he asked me to calculate another triangle area, and that motivated me to write an interactive tool to him to calculate it by himself. 

The formular is simple but still inconvenient to calculate it on cellphone.

Therefore, I decide to start to learn Shiny App to write the simple application.

And here is the output, it's not fancy, but a good start.
